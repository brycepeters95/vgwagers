We may update the content on this Website from time to time, but its content is not necessarily complete or up-to-date. Any of the material on the Website may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material. 
<br></br>
<h3>Information About You and Your Visits to the Website</h3>
All information we collect on this Website is subject to our Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy. 
<br></br>
<h2>Tax Forms</h2>
If your winnings from wagers total over six hundred dollars ($600.00), we will issue you an IRS Form 1099.  In order to do so, we require you to provide your social security number and mailing address.  
<br></br>
<h3>Other Terms and Conditions</h3>
Additional terms and conditions may also apply to specific portions, services, or features of the Website. All such additional terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms of Use.
<br></br>
<h5>Adding Funds to Your Website Account</h5>

You must add funds to your account on the Website before you can participate in wagers.  In order to do so, you must first verify the email address you used to register with the Website.  Your account may be funded by initiating a transaction on the Website through PayPal or such other payment processor as we may designate from time to time in our sole discretion (the “Payment Processor”).  The Payment Processor currently charges a service fee for the funding transaction.  The Payment Processor may change the service fee in its discretion.  Funds are added to your account balance with us after the Payment Processor confirms the funding transaction.  You may then compete in wagers.  You may view the funds available in your account on the Website at any time on the Website bank page.  
<br></br>
<h5> Withdrawing Funds from Your Website Account</h5>
You must have an account with the Payment Processor to withdraw funds from your Website account.  You may initiate a request to withdraw funds on the Website.  If the funds are available for transfer (e.g., are not subject to a dispute or waiver) and the Payment Processor determines that you have sufficient funds, the Payment Processor will send to the email address that you used to register your account a link that you may use to complete the withdrawal.  Funds withdrawn from your account with the Website will be added to your account with the Payment Processor.  
<br></br>	
<h5> Wagers </h5>
Current wager fees are located here: VGWAGERS.COM/HOW-TO.  You may view information about wagers that you have created or accepted.  Such information may include a chat page where you may message others involved in the wager, the users that are a part of the wager, the home team (the team of the user who created the wager with up to 5 other players), the away team (the team that accepted the wager, which can include up to 6 players), the amount of wager per user, the wager creation date and time, status of the wager (accepted or declined), the game that is subject to the wager, a description of the challenge, the decision selected on the winner or loser of the wager, and such other information as we may make available from time to time.  The user that created the wager can cancel the wager until each user that is subject to the wager has accepted.  After each user that is subject to the wager has accepted, the wager cannot be cancelled.  
<br></br>
The user who creates the wager may designate the wager as public or private.  If the wager is private, then all invited user(s) must accept the wager within one hour after creation, and play the game that is subject to the waiver within one hour after all users have accepted the wager.  Only invited users can accept a private wager.  If the wager is public, it will be displayed publicly on the Website and any other user may accept the wager.  Public wagers must be accepted within two hours after creation, and the game that is subject to the wager must be played within two hours after the wager is accepted.  An individual user may only participate in one private wager and one public wager at any given time.  
<br></br>
Once any wager (public or private) has been created, the wager will automatically be cancelled if other required user(s) do not accept within the time periods stated above.  Upon cancellation, funds of any users who have accepted the wager will be returned automatically.  Once a wager has been accepted by all applicable users, the winner must be determined within one hour of completing the game specified in reference to the particular wager and identifying the winner of the wager on the applicable dashboard.  Failure to identify the winner of the wager on the applicable dashboard is deemed an automatic loss.  
<br></br>	
<h5>Disputes</h5>
In the event that one or more users disagree on who won a wager, the user disputing the outcome must complete the dispute form located in the “Disputes” page of the Website within seventy-two hours after the game that is subject to the waiver is complete.  Dispute forms will not be reviewed unless all requested information is completed.  Videos and images may be submitted along with a completed dispute form.  After we receive a completed form and any supporting evidence from the user(s) disputing the outcome, we will give the non-disputing user(s) an opportunity to respond to the dispute form and associated evidence.  If the non-disputing user(s) do not respond, the disputing player automatically wins the dispute.  After both sides are provided an opportunity to respond/provide evidence, the admin assigned to the dispute will render a decision, which is final and will not be subject to challenge.    
<br></br>
Users should regularly check their account for disputes during the seventy-two period within which a dispute may be initiated and during any period in which a user is involved in an active dispute.   If a user loses more than three disputes in any seven-day period, the user will be banned from the Website for seven days following the day on which the user lost his/her fourth dispute.  We reserve the right to ban users who we determine, in our sole discretion, have excessive dispute losses.
